            <p>
              Hello to everyone, my good ones!
              Welcome to our warm, family site!
              Here we tried to answer all the basic questions about dogs and seals:
              Chinese crested breed, Russian toy terrier, papillon (papillon)
              (continental toy-spaniel), as well as Scottish chinchillas, Neva masquerade cats.
              So! My name is Tatyana, I have been breeding the Chinese crested breed since 2014.
              I live in Belarus, in a small but very beautiful town on the banks of the Dnieper River
              in the Gomel region, in Rechitsa. < br >
              Since childhood, I love children and zhivotnykhðŸ˜»
            </p>
            <p>
              My first memories are very bright, joyful and associated with kotyatamiðŸ¤—
              I remember that in childhood it happened that newborn kittens were left in a ditch,
              and I found and fed them from the pipette and found loving owners as a teenager.
              People knew that I was nursing animals, so I more than once found animal foundries under the door.
            </p>
            <p>
              Love for our smaller brothers was given to me from above and my whole life
              from the earliest childhood associated with zhivotnymiðŸ¤—
              Already as an adult, in our family we always lived with animals.
              Our family is big:
              three children, many different animals, so it was never boring.
              I love fuss, running and veselyeðŸ¥°
              Very rarely can you see me at the height of the day sitting in one place in the tishineðŸ˜‚
            </p>
            <h3>The Birth of My Love for a Chinese Crested Dog</h3>
            <p>
              I will tell you how my great love for this wonderful breed was born
              <strong> Chinese crested. </strong>
              My nephew talked to the breeders of this breed and invited me to go
              look at the newly born babies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've had animals all my life and I've always loved them.
              There have always been different breeds of dogs in the family: collie, toy terrier, taxi...
              there were Persian cats, sphinx, Siamese and Angora cats, there were still rats,
              mice and hamsters, guinea pigs, parrots and even a hedgehog and dove lived at one time.
              Of course, not at the same time, so that you are not afraid!
            </p>
            <p>
              We always lived together, together with the children we always looked after animals!
            </p>
            <p>
              At that time, I had only a cat at home and it seemed that something was missing in my soul,
              namely, I wanted to have a dog. I was going to buy a dog of the toyterrier breed
              and for the sake of curiosity, I went to look at an unusual breed for me....
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as I saw this chocolate nose and huge white ears...
              and these eye buttons drove me crazy, and inside like something clicked,
              I could not think about anything more and fell in love with her without memory!
            </p>
            <p>
              This day changed my whole life and I am grateful to fate,
              that this little girl showed up! And now I can't imagine life without it!
            </p>
            <p>
              March 7, 2013 is a special day for me:
              my favorite Rebecca was born, affectionately Bekkichka!
            </p>
            <p>
              Apparently it was the fate to meet Becky,
              to know and love this wonderful breed,
              after all, at that time almost no one knew about them in our city.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wish you to find happiness in the form of your beloved pet!
              I am always warm at heart when I talk about my favorites and hope,
              that it will also touch your hearts warmly.
            </p>
